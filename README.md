# libigl-examples
This repository contains examples applications that use [libigl](libigl.github.io/libigl/). They've been tested on Mac OS X. Most are too involved or special purpose to be part of the [libigl tutorial](libigl.github.io/libigl/tutorial/tutorial.html).

## GLUT

Nearly all of these examples depend on GLUT. On Mac OS X, glut is deprecated
but still included. However, I'd recommend replacing it with a [modified
glut](https://github.com/alecjacobson/glut) that supports scroll wheel and the
command âŒ˜ key.
